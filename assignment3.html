   Class: UMass Lowell 91.61 GUI Programming I,
   updated by MP on September 16, 2018 at 9:54 AM
   Description: This webpage serves as a documentation of all of
   my assignments for 91.61 GUI Programming I. The home page
   introduces myself and has the header "How to create an HTML5 Document"
   On that page I introduce myself and give a quick brief overview of the website.
   Also on the home page there is the structure of a HTML document along with
   examples from the second day of class. Then at the bottom of the page I have
   links to my assignments from the class. This is the page I had to create for
   the third Assinment. This assingment was all about CSS so all my work is in the
   pacific.css file.
