   Description: This webpage serves as a documentation of all of
   my assignments for 91.61 GUI Programming I. This particular page is actually a
   remake of assignemnt 2. This page has the same information but I have edited teh page
   with better css and formatted the html with sections and div containers with class
   names for easy styling. The css for this page is located at css/assign4style.css.
   This is where all the magic happens so take a look at that to see what is happening
   to the page.

        <h1>How to create an HTML5 Document</h1>
        <h3>by: Marc Pierre</h3>
        <p><strong>About the author:</strong>
            Hello! My name is Marc Pierre and I am a computer science major at
            UMass Lowell. I am a junior and looking to graduate with my bachelor's degree
            in May 2020. This webpage is going to consist of my prior knowledge of html
            as well as the teaching in my GUI Programming I course. Along with being
            educational, all of my examples will help me introduce myself to my classmates
            and professor. This first page gives a brief overview of the structure of
            an html document. Please see the links at the bottom of the page for
            examples and my assignments from class Enjoy!</p>

    <section class="structure">
      <div>
        <h2 id = structHead>Structure</h2>
        <p>One of the first things we talked about in GUI I was structure. Everything
        needs some kind of structure and since html is a markup language
        (hypertext markup language) it's structure is no different than that of a word
        document. The structure of a html document consists of:</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="boxes">
      <div class="box">
        <h4 class="structh4">Document Type: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </h4>
        <p> At the beginning of any html document you must define the type. In this case
         &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; html means the document is using HTML5.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
         <h4 class="structh4">HTML and Language:</h4>
        <p>Right after the type we want to create html tags. This defines the beginning
          and the end of our html document. But before we can start typing away we must
          first define the language our document will be written in. This is a pretty
          big deal for a document that is all text. This can be done simply by
          adding the attribute "lang" in the opening html tag. (EX: &lt;html lang="en"&gt;).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h4 class="structh4">Head Tag:</h4>
        <p>After the language we want to setup the head of our page. The head is not seen
        on the physical page if we were to open the document in a web browser but it serves
        a crucial task. Its job is to set things up so the document works as intended.
        Between the Head tags the first thing you'll need is the character set of the document.
        This can be done by adding the &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; tag. After that is
        included you're all set to start on the body. However if there are stylesheets,
        meta data, title, or other links and attributes you want to connect to the
        document you can do so within the head tags.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h4 class="structh4">Body Tag:</h4>
        <p>This is the part that everyone cares about. The body of the document. This
        is where all the text you see on a webpage lives. This webpage will be going over
        the tags that you'll find between the body tags and how they make your text look.</p>
