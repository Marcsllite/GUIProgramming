           <div class="Tags"> <!-- Container that holds all the information about tags -->
             <h1 class="sectHead">TAGS:</h1>
             <p>Before we can get into putting things on the page, first we must talk
             about tags. Tags are the syntax of html. They tell the computer how you want
             your text to appear/what kind of text it is. All tags share the same structure.
             A tag for a particular element can either require an opening and closing tag
             or just an opening tag. A tag looks like this:</p>
             <div class="examples">
                 <p> Opening Tag: &lt;html&gt; <br> <br> Closing Tag: &lt;/html&gt; </p>
             </div>
             <p>Now that we know what a tag normally looks like we can start talking about
             some of the tags we can use in an html document.</p>
           </div>
           <hr> <!-- Horizonal line for aesthetics and readibility -->
           <div class="Headings"> <!-- Container that holds all the information about headings -->
             <h1 class="sectHead">HEADINGS:</h1>
             <p>In HTML5 there are 6 different heading sizes you can use. They are numbered
             from 1-6 and all follow the same pattern to use them. The largest size is
             heading 1 (&lt;h1&gt;). The rest of the heading follow this same naming convention.
             (i.e &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;) make a text into a
             heading all you need to do is encapsulate the desired text in the proper
             heading tag. Headings require both an opening and closing tag to work properly.
             If done correctly the end result should look something like this:</p>
             <div class="examples">
                 <h1>Heading 1</h1> <h2>Heading 2</h2> <h3>Heading 3</h3>
                 <h4>Heading 4</h4> <h5>Heading 5</h5> <h6>Heading 6</h6>
             </div>
           </div>
           <hr> <!-- Horizonal line for aesthetics and readibility -->
           <div class="paragraphs"> <!-- Container to hold all information about the pararaph tags -->
             <h1 class="sectHead">PARAGRAPHS:</h1>
             <p>Paragraphs are one of the most used things in an html document. Any text
             that isn't special in some way is lumped into the paragraph tag. The text you
             are reading right now is displayed using the paragraph tags. Paragraph tags,
             similarly to heading tags require an opening tag and closing tag and look
             like this:</p>
             <div class="examples"> <!-- Container to hold examples. ID is examples for easy styling -->
                 <p> Opening Paragraph Tag: &lt;p&gt; <br>
                  <br> Closing Paragraph Tag: &lt;/p&gt; </p>
             </div>
             <p>If you want to make a word or line bold or italicized within a paragraph
             or anywhere else for that matter there are tags for that. To make a text
             bold all you have to do is wrap the text around a bold tag (&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;).
             And similarly to make a text italicized you wrap that text around a italics tag
             (&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;)</p>
             <div class="examples"> <!-- Container to hold examples. ID is examples for easy styling -->
                 <p> Here's what a <b>bold</b> text looks like. <br>
                  <br> Here's what an <i>italicized</i> text looks like.</p>
             </div>
             <p>A similar thing applied if you need to add super and subscripts to your
             paragraphs. Just wrap the text you would like to see in that manner in the
             corresponding tag. (superscript: &lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;;
             subscript: &lt;sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;)</p>
             <div class="examples"> <!-- Container to hold examples. ID is examples for easy styling -->
                 <p> Here's what a <sup>superscript</sup> text looks like. <br>
                  <br> Here's what a <sub>subscript</sub> text looks like.</p>
             </div>
             <p>We've covered a few things on paragraphs except maybe one of the most
             important aspect. Line breaks! What if you want to write a poem or something
             that requires you to go to the next line on the page. The answer isn't as simple
             as just pressing enter when writing inside your html document.
             <p>The extra spaces and newlines you use inside the paragraph tags are not
             shown on the page. The computer just takes all your words and places them on
             one line until that line is full. in order to go to a new line you must use
             a line break tag.</p>
             <p> This tag, unlike all the other tags we've talked about so far only
              requires an opening tag.</p>
             <div class="examples"> <!-- Container to hold examples. ID is examples for easy styling -->
               <p>Line break tag: &lt;br&gt;</p>
               <p>Example of using a line <br> break tag in a sentence.</p>

            <strong>About the author:</strong>
            Hello! My name is Marc Pierre and I am a computer science major at
            UMass Lowell. I am a junior and looking to graduate with my bachelor's degree
            in May 2020. This webpage is going to consist of my prior knowledge of html
            as well as the teaching in my GUI Programming I course. Along with being
            educational, all of my examples will help me introduce myself to my classmates
            and professor. This first page gives a brief overview of the structure of
            an html document. Please see the links at the bottom of the page for
            examples and my assignments from class Enjoy! </p>

          <div id="Structure"> <!-- Container to hold the section about the structure of a html document -->
            <h2 id = structHead>Structure</h2>
            <p>One of the first things we talked about in GUI I was structure. Everything
            needs some kind of structure and since html is a markup language
            (hypertext markup language) it's structure is no different than that of a word
            document. The structure of a html document consists of:</p>

            <h4 class="structh4">Document Type: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </h4>
            <p> At the beginning of any html document you must define the type. In this case
             &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; html means the document is using HTML5.</p>

            <h4 class="structh4">HTML and Language:</h4>
            <p>Right after the type we want to create html tags. This defines the beginning
              and the end of our html document. But before we can start typing away we must
              first define the language our document will be written in. This is a pretty
              big deal for a document that is all text. This can be done simply by
              adding the attribute "lang" in the opening html tag. (EX: &lt;html lang="en"&gt;).</p>

            <h4 class="structh4">Head Tag:</h4>
            <p>After the language we want to setup the head of our page. The head is not seen
            on the physical page if we were to open the document in a web browser but it serves
            a crucial task. Its job is to set things up so the document works as intended.
            Between the Head tags the first thing you'll need is the character set of the document.
            This can be done by adding the &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; tag. After that is
            included you're all set to start on the body. However if there are stylesheets,
            meta data, title, or other links and attributes you want to connect to the
            document you can do so within the head tags.</p>

            <h4 class="structh4">Body Tag:</h4>
            <p>This is the part that everyone cares about. The body of the document. This
            is where all the text you see on a webpage lives. This webpage will be going over
            the tags that you'll find between the body tags and how they make your text look.</p>
          </div>
          <hr> <!-- Horizonal line for aesthetics and readibility -->
